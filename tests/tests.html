<p>Software started as a <em>personal</em> science for me as an adolescent - peeking and poking at <em>personal</em> computers CTM close to the metal, peering and pairing at personal communications CTM close to mind.

post_content_html: <h3 id="cobind-retrospective-twenty-years-later">Cobind Retrospective: Twenty Years Later</h3>
<h4 id="archeology">Archeology</h4>
<p>In the summer of 2003, Bryan Mills and I were working on a variety of projects together when we got a call from a friend
about working on an early stage tech stack that his startup was putting together.</p>
<p>That ideation process evolved into the startup we would cofound a year later called Cobind. </p>
<p>The inflection point occurred when I had a dream one night, got up, and said, &quot;we enable anyone to create and download a custom linux distro from the web browser&quot;.</p>
<p>At that point, we really just had a set of build scripts that took some parameters on one side and built a custom linux CD-
ROM on the other.</p>
<p>A year later, we&#39;d have a browser-based build system capable of slicing and dicing an application, its dependencies, and
its branding into a complete product stack built into a CD-ROM downloadable ISO from a build farm.</p>
<h4 id="cobind-diy-linux-build-tools">Cobind DIY Linux Build Tools</h4>
<p>And so we set out to build the Cobind DIY Linux build tools: a web-based application that front-ended a build farm for
building and downloading a custom CD-ROM containing your application, your branding, and your dependencies all baked
into the CD-ROM, which could then be burnt to a CD-ROM drive.</p>
<p>This should sound familiar to anyone working in cloud today, but then it seemed impossible until the demo burnt a CD-ROM.</p>
<h4 id="what-looks-good-might-break-the-company">What Looks Good Might Break The Company</h4>
<p>I realized we needed a test case for the build tools The idea of the <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1191/">Cobind Desktop</a> materialized as a minimalist linux
distro to solve the testing problem.</p>
<p>Cobind Desktop would almost kill Cobind because the desktop got so popular that we couldn&#39;t afford our bandwidth after a single night in the tens-of-thousands of downloads because it was free.</p>
<p>We had a fellowship and in a whirlwind of activity in under a year, we&#39;d given everything we had in terms of time, money, and
spirit. We hadn&#39;t run out of time or spirit, but Cobind had run out of money.</p>
<p>Failure is the greatest teacher.</p>
<p>Today, Bryan Mills works for Google Pittsburgh while I&#39;ve ricocheted from startups to R&amp;D labs like an air hockey puck.</p>
<h4 id="the-blameless-post-mortem">The Blameless Post Mortem</h4>
<p>At the turn of the century, it was all about kiosks and branding - the physical computing experience. </p>
<p>Novel ideas languish until the ecosystem envelops them and makes them seem early, or as we like to say, <strong>only obvious in retrospect</strong>. We realized this while entertaining conversations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progeny_Linux_Systems">progeny</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPath">rPath</a>, and <a href="https://www.timesys.com/">timesys</a>. </p>
<p>Today, it&#39;s bittersweet to realize how linux spins or flavors or derivatives are just a few clicks away when we typed fast and furious to produce the demo redolent of any startup twenty years ago.</p>
<h4 id="what-we-learned">What We Learned</h4>
<p>We both agree that the following things would have made our startup journey easier:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>A coworking community. Emphasis on <a href="https://www.tnmagazine.org/small-town-big-ideas/">community</a>, not money.</li>
<li>A salesperson. Beyond the demo we needed to &quot;always be selling&quot; but neither of us had <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226281641_Genetic_and_neurological_foundations_of_customer_orientation_Field_and_experimental_evidence">the sales gene</a>. </li>
<li>Funding alternatives. <a href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/the-first-money-is-the-most-expensive-money-ae47c6eb71c">The first money is the most expensive money</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We both are sentimental about what might have been, but share deeply in the realization that nothing could have opened as
many doors in our future than the learning that comes from cofounding a startup. We have <a href="https://alphalabgear.org/mentors/fred-gohh/">Fred Gohh</a> and <a href="https://www.ideafoundry.org/">Idea Foundry</a> to thank for that.</p>

post_content_html: <h3 id="dexcom-g6">Dexcom G6</h3>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p>I&#39;m not a doctor and this essay should not be taken as medical advice. It is an
honest review by a type 1 diabetic, including decades of day-to-day with
insulin pumps and years with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM). I&#39;ve also
worked in medical devices and digital health.</p>
<h4 id="dexcom-g6-1">Dexcom G6</h4>
<p>I got the Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6 on November 11, 2019, so in November 2022, I&#39;ve spent 3 years with the device managing my day-to-day
blood glucose.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>The first insight for me when I got the X2:G6 combo was that it was tiresome to
reach for the pump frequently just to check my blood glucose.</p>
<p>Getting the BG from the Dexcom G6 on my phone took more effort because I have a
Google Pixel, which was not supported by Dexcom in 2019 and is sadly still not supported today. The ecosystem of smart phones and their app stores and software has remained a competitive disadvantage for Dexcom. Dexcom has made it clear from their dismal product support around smart phone apps that they simply do not understand the fact that the usability of their products is directly impacted by the mobile ecosystem 24x7x365.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&#39;s a very capable individual doing custom builds of the Android version of the Dexcom app on the internet. Just go through the form and you&#39;ll receive an APK build that can be loaded on an unsupported phone like my Pixel. It has
worked perfectly for me for 3 years now. That person deserves kudos!</p>
<p>Once I realized that checking BG on my phone was going to be nearly as tiresome
as on the insulin pump itself, I decided to check out watches, reflecting that
blood glucose is arguably the killer app for digital watches, especially for
someone who is highly active like me. I quickly realized that the Dexcom G6 supported the Apple Watch pretty well, but that wasn&#39;t an option for me having an Android phone.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the cost of the Apple ecosystem having used it
previously.</p>
<p>The real leap in learning came when I discovered an app on Github that runs on
Fitbit Versa, Sense and similar devices. A quick trip to BestBuy and some
configuration meant that I could track my BG on my wrist while exercising for a
little over $100. </p>
<p>Glance has been a game changer for me since I use it daily
when running or walking the dog and at-a-glance while sleeping has alerted me
to problems that I otherwise would have missed. Kudos to Ryan Mason!</p>
<p>Once you get past the excellent Dexcom Clarity app, the most well-designed of
the apps available is SugarMate. I use it everyday for information-rich spot

<h4 id="cost">Cost</h4>
<p>Dexcom G6 sensors are expensive though that&#39;s started to change now that we have
competition in the form of the Abbott Freestyle Libre 2. </p>
<p>G6 Sensors are over $300 per box of 3, each with a 10 day usage, 
with a membership and a prescription at Costco pharmacy. </p>
<p>This is the best pricing I&#39;ve found without US health insurance.</p>
<p>There is competition in CGMs, but that competition is limited, given the proprietary integration with the insulin pump. This remains a sore spot in the ecosystem, even today.</p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<p>I&#39;m a big believer in evidence-based medicine. It&#39;s early but there&#39;s some
interesting evidence available already. The easiest way to demonstrate the
effectiveness of a medical device is 24x7x365 use for years with
results. That population suvey is n of 1 or quantified self, and there&#39;s more
to it than just the medical device (diet, exercise, and insulin);
however, the medical device plays an outsized role in making good results
possible, probable, and predictable, if not perfect.</p>
<p>The gold standard of results in diabetes control is Hemoglobin A1c. My HbA1c
was 8.9 prior to acquiring the Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6 in the fall of 2019 and HbA1c tested in the same lab at 6.4 in February of 2020, and 6.0 in January of 2022</p>
<ul>
<li>both below the diagnostic threshold for type 1 diabetes, after only 3 months with the X2, G6, and Basal
IQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve found GMI to be conservative, meaning that GMI is generally
higher than my lab&#39;s HbA1c - roughly .5 - 1.0 higher on average.</p>
<p>Regardless, the evidence speaks for itself. Prior to acquiring the X2 and G6, I
had no way of approaching perfect control, where perfect control is defined as
100% in range for T1D which is is generally accepted as 70-180 mg/dl. </p>
<p>Today, I routinely have days where my blood sugar is 100% in control and most days are
above the 70% in control benchmark, regardless of diet or exercise.</p>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<p>After using the G6 24x7x365 daily for 3 years, the one challenge that has emerged is that Dexcom G6 sensors are simply not reliable for me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thin and highly active having BMI &lt; 20, training daily, completing a half marathon in 2021, and a full marathon in 2022. My endocrinologist points out that those characteristics present challenges for using subcutaneous adipose tissue as a proxy for plasma blood glucose since adipose tissue is not in abundance and these devices show poor data veracity without adequate adipose tissue, particularly in fasted states such as sleep and exercise. This is well-documented in the research literature.</p>
<p>I began seeing these issues with Dexcom G6 sensors in 2020 and the issues worsened in 2021 and have not gotten better in 2022 as my weight declined from 160 pounds to 140 pounds or less. However, at no time has my body fat measurement dropped below 10%. </p>
<p>The amount of time that I spent on the phone with Dexcom support was excessive and frequently at all hours of the night since the problem would present with alarms that cannot be disabled and are able to disable do-not-disturb mode on the smart phone and sound like an alarm system from the Austin Powers series. </p>
<p>That leaves the patient with two choices: tolerance (which is unrealistic at 3 AM) and powering the phone completely off, which silences it while having the side effect that alarms can&#39;t save the patient from potentially life-threatening hypoglycemia given that alarms emanating from the Tandem t:slim X2 alone are not sufficiently intense to wake me.</p>
<p>Dexcom has responded to this crisis by following the letter of the law: since I first reported the problem, they have replaced 2-3 dozen sensors under warranty while following the typical corporate communication playbook of not admitting design flaws or any legal culpability while not admitting the rather serious problem of the fact that, when the G6 is used in concert with a hybrid closed loop system such as the Tandem t:slim X2, inaccurate sensor readings on the low side have the potential to underdose the patient, and inaccurate sensor readings on the high side have the potential to overdose the patient. </p>
<p><strong>This isn&#39;t just theory!</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen both of these scenarios playout while exercising and sleeping - two events that cannot be precluded, are frighteningly difficult to handle given failures in the aforementioned design of the alarm system, and no one at either Tandem or Dexcom seems to admit, document, or address which is distressing given that these are FDA-regulated devices in markets that aren&#39;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25">Therac 25</a> but have the potential to end badly in large populations.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Mortem</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to alleviate the problem by wearing two different CGM sensors concurrently. I wore an Abbott Freestyle Libre 2 from spring through fall 2022. That has done little to alleviate the problem since both sensors tend to move in parallel showing the same inaccurate readings in fasted states around sleep and exercise. </p>

  <h3 id="dexcom-g6">Dexcom G6</h3>
<h4 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h4>
<p>I&#39;m not a doctor and this essay should not be taken as medical advice. It is an
honest review by a type 1 diabetic, including decades of day-to-day with
insulin pumps and years with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM). I&#39;ve also
worked in medical devices and digital health.</p>
<h4 id="dexcom-g6-1">Dexcom G6</h4>
<p>I got the Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6 on November 11, 2019, so in November 2022, I&#39;ve spent 3 years with the device managing my day-to-day
blood glucose.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>The first insight for me when I got the X2:G6 combo was that it was tiresome to
reach for the pump frequently just to check my blood glucose.</p>
<p>Getting the BG from the Dexcom G6 on my phone took more effort because I have a
Google Pixel, which was not supported by Dexcom in 2019 and is sadly still not supported today. The ecosystem of smart phones and their app stores and software has remained a competitive disadvantage for Dexcom. Dexcom has made it clear from their dismal product support around smart phone apps that they simply do not understand the fact that the usability of their products is directly impacted by the mobile ecosystem 24x7x365.</p>
<p>Luckily, there&#39;s a very capable individual doing custom builds of the Android version of the Dexcom app on the internet. Just go through the form and you&#39;ll receive an APK build that can be loaded on an unsupported phone like my Pixel. It has
worked perfectly for me for 3 years now. That person deserves kudos!</p>
<p>Once I realized that checking BG on my phone was going to be nearly as tiresome
as on the insulin pump itself, I decided to check out watches, reflecting that
blood glucose is arguably the killer app for digital watches, especially for
someone who is highly active like me. I quickly realized that the Dexcom G6 supported the Apple Watch pretty well, but that wasn&#39;t an option for me having an Android phone.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the cost of the Apple ecosystem having used it
previously.</p>
<p>The real leap in learning came when I discovered an app on Github that runs on
Fitbit Versa, Sense and similar devices. A quick trip to BestBuy and some
configuration meant that I could track my BG on my wrist while exercising for a
little over $100. </p>
<p>Glance has been a game changer for me since I use it daily
when running or walking the dog and at-a-glance while sleeping has alerted me
to problems that I otherwise would have missed. Kudos to Ryan Mason!</p>
<p>Once you get past the excellent Dexcom Clarity app, the most well-designed of
the apps available is SugarMate. I use it everyday for information-rich spot

post_content_html: <h3 id="tandem-tslim-x2">Tandem t:slim X2</h3>
<h4 id="tandem-tslim-x2-and-dexcom-g6">Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6</h4>
<p>I got the Tandem t:slim X2 on November 11, 2019, so as of
November 2022, I&#39;ve spent 3 years with the device managing my day-to-day
blood glucose.</p>
<p>The timing of my purchase in the fall of 2019 meant that Tandem offered a free
upgrade to its Control IQ technology when the pump shipped with Basal IQ
technology installed. The long story short is that Basal IQ could prevent lows
by diminishing insulin supply but it could not do what Control IQ does which is
to provide increased basal rates and automatic correction boluses. I got the
upgrade from Basal IQ to Control IQ around late spring 2020. It has made a
difference in my control, particularly around exercise, sleep, and fasting - peace of mind.</p>
<p>Basal IQ was a leap forward given its event-driven (closed-loop) nature, since
low blood sugars are high risk events that correlate with injury and death. By
comparison, Control-IQ is a quantum leap, since dosing on the high side is
still difficult, mostly owing to carb-to-insulin ratios and the guess work
involved in calculating doses between insulin-on-board and carbohydrate-on-
board. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to say Control-IQ is like a 1-2 punch in diabetes control, but
that&#39;s understating the difficulty of lows around intense exercise and post-
prandial highs. There&#39;s more algorithmic development required to keep those
totally in check. But I&#39;m splitting hairs - the difference between 70% in range
being good enough and 100% in range being perfect.</p>
<p>I expect the next few years will lead to algorithmic improvements that are
truly mind-blowing and remove the need for David Goggins levels of self-
regulation. In addition, I&#39;m sure there are machine learning researchers
looking at this data now since Dexcom and Tandem have a treasure trove of
easily-anonymized data. Combine that data with data from a fitbit or Apple
Watch and you&#39;ve got three pillars for significant improvement. The only thing
that leaves out is precise measurement of food. That
can be overcome with ketogenic diets as several proponents have demonstrated
and I&#39;ve leaned in that direction for a decade or so. I link to some of those
proponents below.</p>
<p>Control IQ has sleep and exercise activities or modes. The exercise mode helps,
but it&#39;s generally not tunable enough to completely prevent lows around
exercise.</p>
<p>I can usually leave the pump on the default Control-IQ mode and get good but
not perfect results most of the time assuming no exercise and normal diet, but
the best results come from a hack that I learned watching a youtube video. That
is, use sleep mode to impose a lower target and more aggressive algorithmic
behavior to reach that 110 target. I leave the pump in sleep mode most of the
time. I get the best results when I use sleep mode 24x7x365, even when
exercising. I can go out now with a BG of 110 and run 5 or 10 miles at a moderate pace
with little rise or fall. This is fat burning at work. That was never possible prior to my switch to using
sleep mode to manage exercise. It may be an outlier, but it works for me and
indeed, it&#39;s a game-changer.</p>
<h4 id="reservoirs-and-infusion-sets">Reservoirs and Infusion Sets</h4>
<p>A big difference between the Tandem/Dexcom ecosystem and Minimed/Medtronic
ecosystem is disposable parts: reservoirs, infusion sets, sensors, and
transmitters. I&#39;m not going to go into every detail here but my experience with
Dexcom/Tandem has been positive with few exceptions.</p>
<p>Before switching to Tandem/Dexcom, I&#39;d had frequent issues with infusion site
redness, dislodged cannulas, and dislodged CGM sensors, regardless of insulin,
site change frequency, or location. After 3 years with the Tandem pump, I&#39;ve had
zero issues with site redness after 365 days and not a single time that the
cannula dislodged from my skin in the same time period despite having dropped
the pump from waist high or caught the tubing on a door handle. I use 23&quot;
tubing which puts the pump about knee high when it drops, so no damage occurs
from it hitting the floor even though the weight of the pump dropping induces anxiety.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>The software ecosystem evolving around these devices is growing rapidly, as the
devices have proliferated. The biggest game changer their is likely xDrip since it can overcome several problems with the closed proprietary software ecosystem that these medical device companies use.</p>
<p>The first insight for me when I got the X2:G6 combo was that it was tiresome to
reach for the pump frequently just to check my blood glucose. Getting the BG from the Dexcom G6 on my phone took more effort because I have a
Google Pixel, which was not supported by Dexcom in 2019 or now in 2022. Dexcom is simply not in the right decade as far as mobile software support is concerned. </p>
<p>Luckily, there&#39;s a very capable individual doing custom builds of the Android version of the Dexcom app on the internet. Just go through the form and you&#39;ll receive an APK build that can be loaded on an unsupported phone like my Pixel. It has
worked perfectly for a year for me. That person deserves kudos!</p>
<p>Once I realized that checking BG on my phone was going to be nearly as tiresome
as on the insulin pump itself, I decided to check out watches, reflecting that
blood glucose is arguably the killer app for digital watches, especially for
someone who is highly active. I quickly realized that Dexcom supported the
Apple Watch pretty well, but that wasn&#39;t an option for me having an Android
phone.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the cost of the Apple ecosystem having used it
previously.</p>
<p>The real leap in learning came when I discovered an app on Github that runs on
Fitbit Versa, Sense, and similar devices. A quick trip to BestBuy and some
configuration meant that I could track my BG on my wrist while exercising for a
little over $100. Glance has been a game changer for me since I use it daily
when running or walking the dog and at-a-glance while sleeping has alerted me
to problems that I otherwise would have missed. Kudos to Ryan Mason!
Once you get past the excellent Dexcom Clarity app, the most well-designed of
the apps available is SugarMate. I use it everyday for information-rich spot
checks.Sugarmate joins the list of quick exit diabetes startups acquired by
either Dexcom or Tandem, like TypeZero.</p>
<h4 id="usability">Usability</h4>
<p>Tandem x2:slim has thoughtful design. The direct manipulation interface that
Tandem presents on it&#39;s main screen is intuitive since you can just tap the 3
HR indicator to toggle through the hourly graph modes and tap the status
indicator to see status details.</p>
<p>That direct manipulation intuitiveness goes away when you descend into the
options menu. Most of these functions are not frequently accessed, so probably
aren&#39;t important day-to-day. However, the ones that are used more frequently do
not have the at-a-glance one tap reachability that they should while
discoverability is poor and menus are long and scrolling. The options menus
frequently require too many taps to reach the leaf node of the options tree.</p>
<p>When I first used the Tandem infusion sets and reservoirs, the design of the
injector and reservoir seemed weird. The crinkly sound of filling the
reservoirs as the bag expands with insulin and the transformer rocket launcher
design of the infusion sets had me puzzled. However, after 3 years of using them
daily, they seem clever and reliable. I&#39;ve not had an infusion set fail due to
manufacturing issues.</p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<p>I&#39;m a big believer in evidence-based medicine. It&#39;s early but there&#39;s some
interesting evidence available already. The easiest way to demonstrate the
effectiveness of a medical device is 24x7x365 use for a year or so with
results. That population suvey is n of 1 or quantified self, and there&#39;s more
to it than just the medical device (diet, exercise, and self-regulation);
however, the medical device plays an outsized role in making good results
possible, probable, and predictable, if not perfect.</p>
<p>The gold standard of results in diabetes control is Hemoglobin A1c. My HbA1c
was 8.9 prior to acquiring the Tandem t:slim X2 in the fall of 2019, and it
tested in the same lab at 6.4 in February of 2020, and 6.0 in January of 2022, 
both below the diagnostic threshold for type 1 diabetes, 
after only 3 months with the X2, G6, and Basal IQ. 
I&#39;ve found GMI to be conservative, meaning that GMI is generally .5 
higher than my lab&#39;s HbA1c.</p>
<p>Regardless, the evidence speaks for itself. Prior to acquiring the X2, I
had no way of approaching perfect control, where perfect control is defined as
100% in range for T1D which is is generally accepted as 70-180. Today, I
routinely have days where my blood sugar is 100% in control and most days are
above the 70% in control benchmark, regardless of diet or exercise.</p>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<p>In 2022, I&#39;ve started to see some cracks in the armor of Tandem&#39;s t:slim X2 Control IQ algorithm. In particular, I&#39;ve had incident occur in fasted states which cannot be traced back to data veracity issues with Dexcom G6 as I&#39;ve done in my article on the G6. Rather, these over-zealous delivery problems seem to occur in the default mode of the t:slim X2 without using sleep mode and can occur even under the theoretically under-zealous exercise mode. </p>
<p>That is, I&#39;ve seen continued basal delivery with hypoglycemia less than or equal to 70 mg/dl. When I contacted the company about this, I was told that it accrues to the fact that there is a window of latency in the 30 minute timing of the predictive algorithm. In other words, even though the current blood glucose is hypoglycemic, the algorithm is making its dosing decision based on the theoretical prediction of the blood glucose 30 minutes in the future.</p>
<p>The obvious problem here are the fasted states of exercise and sleep in which, without glucagon or glycogen, the blood glucose is unlikely to move upward, and again, this occurred in normal mode without sleep or activity mode enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Mortem</strong></p>
<p>The limitation is the Control IQ algorithm is worrying since it could exacerbate an already problematic hypoglycemia with unintended dose and subsequent side effects.</p>
<p>This is yet another of those cases that require regulatory oversight because it&#39;s not clear to me that the deeper point is lost between corporate communication and legal culpability.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the latency in the devices are beholden to the latency in the sensors. Similar to sensors in self-driving cars, predictive autonomous behavior will only be perfect when the sensors approach subsecond event emission with improved data veracity. </p>
<p><strong>Autonomy in medical devices is subject to the same rules as self-driving</strong>. </p>

  <h3 id="tandem-tslim-x2">Tandem t:slim X2</h3>
<h4 id="tandem-tslim-x2-and-dexcom-g6">Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6</h4>
<p>I got the Tandem t:slim X2 on November 11, 2019, so as of
November 2022, I&#39;ve spent 3 years with the device managing my day-to-day
blood glucose.</p>
<p>The timing of my purchase in the fall of 2019 meant that Tandem offered a free
upgrade to its Control IQ technology when the pump shipped with Basal IQ
technology installed. The long story short is that Basal IQ could prevent lows
by diminishing insulin supply but it could not do what Control IQ does which is
to provide increased basal rates and automatic correction boluses. I got the
upgrade from Basal IQ to Control IQ around late spring 2020. It has made a
difference in my control, particularly around exercise, sleep, and fasting - peace of mind.</p>
<p>Basal IQ was a leap forward given its event-driven (closed-loop) nature, since
low blood sugars are high risk events that correlate with injury and death. By
comparison, Control-IQ is a quantum leap, since dosing on the high side is
still difficult, mostly owing to carb-to-insulin ratios and the guess work
involved in calculating doses between insulin-on-board and carbohydrate-on-
board. </p>
<p>I&#39;d like to say Control-IQ is like a 1-2 punch in diabetes control, but
that&#39;s understating the difficulty of lows around intense exercise and post-
prandial highs. There&#39;s more algorithmic development required to keep those
totally in check. But I&#39;m splitting hairs - the difference between 70% in range
being good enough and 100% in range being perfect.</p>
<p>I expect the next few years will lead to algorithmic improvements that are
truly mind-blowing and remove the need for David Goggins levels of self-
regulation. In addition, I&#39;m sure there are machine learning researchers
looking at this data now since Dexcom and Tandem have a treasure trove of
easily-anonymized data. Combine that data with data from a fitbit or Apple
Watch and you&#39;ve got three pillars for significant improvement. The only thing
that leaves out is precise measurement of food. That
can be overcome with ketogenic diets as several proponents have demonstrated
and I&#39;ve leaned in that direction for a decade or so. I link to some of those
proponents below.</p>
<p>Control IQ has sleep and exercise activities or modes. The exercise mode helps,
but it&#39;s generally not tunable enough to completely prevent lows around
exercise.</p>
<p>I can usually leave the pump on the default Control-IQ mode and get good but
not perfect results most of the time assuming no exercise and normal diet, but
the best results come from a hack that I learned watching a youtube video. That
is, use sleep mode to impose a lower target and more aggressive algorithmic
behavior to reach that 110 target. I leave the pump in sleep mode most of the
time. I get the best results when I use sleep mode 24x7x365, even when
exercising. I can go out now with a BG of 110 and run 5 or 10 miles at a moderate pace
with little rise or fall. This is fat burning at work. That was never possible prior to my switch to using
sleep mode to manage exercise. It may be an outlier, but it works for me and
indeed, it&#39;s a game-changer.</p>
<h4 id="reservoirs-and-infusion-sets">Reservoirs and Infusion Sets</h4>
<p>A big difference between the Tandem/Dexcom ecosystem and Minimed/Medtronic
ecosystem is disposable parts: reservoirs, infusion sets, sensors, and
transmitters. I&#39;m not going to go into every detail here but my experience with
Dexcom/Tandem has been positive with few exceptions.</p>
<p>Before switching to Tandem/Dexcom, I&#39;d had frequent issues with infusion site
redness, dislodged cannulas, and dislodged CGM sensors, regardless of insulin,
site change frequency, or location. After 3 years with the Tandem pump, I&#39;ve had
zero issues with site redness after 365 days and not a single time that the
cannula dislodged from my skin in the same time period despite having dropped
the pump from waist high or caught the tubing on a door handle. I use 23&quot;
tubing which puts the pump about knee high when it drops, so no damage occurs
from it hitting the floor even though the weight of the pump dropping induces anxiety.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p>The software ecosystem evolving around these devices is growing rapidly, as the
devices have proliferated. The biggest game changer their is likely xDrip since it can overcome several problems with the closed proprietary software ecosystem that these medical device companies use.</p>
<p>The first insight for me when I got the X2:G6 combo was that it was tiresome to
reach for the pump frequently just to check my blood glucose. Getting the BG from the Dexcom G6 on my phone took more effort because I have a
Google Pixel, which was not supported by Dexcom in 2019 or now in 2022. Dexcom is simply not in the right decade as far as mobile software support is concerned. </p>
<p>Luckily, there&#39;s a very capable individual doing custom builds of the Android version of the Dexcom app on the internet. Just go through the form and you&#39;ll receive an APK build that can be loaded on an unsupported phone like my Pixel. It has
worked perfectly for a year for me. That person deserves kudos!</p>
<p>Once I realized that checking BG on my phone was going to be nearly as tiresome
as on the insulin pump itself, I decided to check out watches, reflecting that
blood glucose is arguably the killer app for digital watches, especially for
someone who is highly active. I quickly realized that Dexcom supported the
Apple Watch pretty well, but that wasn&#39;t an option for me having an Android
phone.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the cost of the Apple ecosystem having used it
previously.</p>
<p>The real leap in learning came when I discovered an app on Github that runs on
Fitbit Versa, Sense, and similar devices. A quick trip to BestBuy and some
configuration meant that I could track my BG on my wrist while exercising for a
little over $100. Glance has been a game changer for me since I use it daily
when running or walking the dog and at-a-glance while sleeping has alerted me
to problems that I otherwise would have missed. Kudos to Ryan Mason!
Once you get past the excellent Dexcom Clarity app, the most well-designed of
the apps available is SugarMate. I use it everyday for information-rich spot
checks.Sugarmate joins the list of quick exit diabetes startups acquired by
either Dexcom or Tandem, like TypeZero.</p>
<h4 id="usability">Usability</h4>
<p>Tandem x2:slim has thoughtful design. The direct manipulation interface that
Tandem presents on it&#39;s main screen is intuitive since you can just tap the 3
HR indicator to toggle through the hourly graph modes and tap the status
indicator to see status details.</p>
<p>That direct manipulation intuitiveness goes away when you descend into the
options menu. Most of these functions are not frequently accessed, so probably
aren&#39;t important day-to-day. However, the ones that are used more frequently do
not have the at-a-glance one tap reachability that they should while
discoverability is poor and menus are long and scrolling. The options menus
frequently require too many taps to reach the leaf node of the options tree.</p>
<p>When I first used the Tandem infusion sets and reservoirs, the design of the
injector and reservoir seemed weird. The crinkly sound of filling the
reservoirs as the bag expands with insulin and the transformer rocket launcher
design of the infusion sets had me puzzled. However, after 3 years of using them
daily, they seem clever and reliable. I&#39;ve not had an infusion set fail due to
manufacturing issues.</p>
<h4 id="pros">Pros</h4>
<p>I&#39;m a big believer in evidence-based medicine. It&#39;s early but there&#39;s some
interesting evidence available already. The easiest way to demonstrate the
effectiveness of a medical device is 24x7x365 use for a year or so with
results. That population suvey is n of 1 or quantified self, and there&#39;s more
to it than just the medical device (diet, exercise, and self-regulation);
however, the medical device plays an outsized role in making good results
possible, probable, and predictable, if not perfect.</p>
<p>The gold standard of results in diabetes control is Hemoglobin A1c. My HbA1c
was 8.9 prior to acquiring the Tandem t:slim X2 in the fall of 2019, and it
tested in the same lab at 6.4 in February of 2020, and 6.0 in January of 2022, 
both below the diagnostic threshold for type 1 diabetes, 
after only 3 months with the X2, G6, and Basal IQ. 
I&#39;ve found GMI to be conservative, meaning that GMI is generally .5 
higher than my lab&#39;s HbA1c.</p>
<p>Regardless, the evidence speaks for itself. Prior to acquiring the X2, I
had no way of approaching perfect control, where perfect control is defined as
100% in range for T1D which is is generally accepted as 70-180. Today, I
routinely have days where my blood sugar is 100% in control and most days are
above the 70% in control benchmark, regardless of diet or exercise.</p>
<h4 id="cons">Cons</h4>
<p>In 2022, I&#39;ve started to see some cracks in the armor of Tandem&#39;s t:slim X2 Control IQ algorithm. In particular, I&#39;ve had incident occur in fasted states which cannot be traced back to data veracity issues with Dexcom G6 as I&#39;ve done in my article on the G6.

<p>It&#39;s difficult to unpack the benefits of personal computing’s insights and innovations given their range. </p>
<p>Just since Y2K, tech’s boat has an increasingly dark patina resembling culture lately.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve used tech’s insights and innovations as brain prosthetics, needed or not, perhaps losing our mastery of mind in the process. </p>
<p>As we begin to fix what’s wrong inside, we need to repaint tech’s dark boat with lighter hues.</p>
<p>By doing so, we may realize that paint may be the mask’s temporary tattoo but it can grow into permanent change in a good way if and only if the masks we wear have a positive patina that emerges slowly over time.</p>
<p>In the process, we use the prosthetics in-hand, all-day, everyday to try to lift our brains with tech’s tide, improving society as a whole and perhaps tech in the process by being the more empathic catalyst for calm we seek.</p>
<p>An experience that’s more empathic and less terrifying may be the result.</p>
<p>The true innovation is having faith in the side effects of contemplative computing, slow computing, or no computing. </p>
<p>We did the same with slow food, diet, and fasting (no food), though it took forty years to reach the US from Italy, or several millennia if you widen the aperture to match global culture beyond capitalism. </p>
<p>Then we realized that fasting doesn’t scale positively or permanently. There are diminishing returns on most things without limits. That makes Christopher Columbus look lightning speed at 61 days!</p>
<p>If you limit yourself so as to incorporate personal counter-measures to tech’s downsides, you may see this just like the relationship between fasting, food, and physical health has emerged slowly. </p>
<p>Hence, we may require an emergent info diet of no-compute, slow-compute, and mental health emerge too to match the fact that fasting doesn’t scale but its downstream effects do!</p>
<p>Looking back, it’s clear that society has been doing similar things around the world for thousands of years, despite the slow and varied empirical evidence. </p>
<p>This spectrum runs from left-field imaginary to the dubious text of apocrypha to fallacious phenomenology, without offending anyone, unless your atheism or scientism are so radical to be at prison&#39;s gate.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t get rid of smartphones, just like we can&#39;t throw away TVs. </p>
<p>The loss would be lossy! </p>
<p>While we can debate the origin of the word “lossy,” we agree that in a social context, “lossy” means the same as when describing data compression of music in mp3 or photos as jpg formats: diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Data compression causes a loss in signal, not noise, detectable mostly by audiophiles and similar fanatics.</p>
<p>This is a group defined by their comfort lurking in asymptotes as if hanging out at the Hillary Step is a good way to spend your time since it promises a short ride in a fast machine down to Nepal. </p>
<p>Sadly, you don’t get to pick your poison on the way down, like you did on the way up!</p>
<p>This experience may only matter if you’re sitting in a big lounge chair, listening to The Bad Plus, realizing that the mp3 codec used to make the recording was, in fact, lossy because your ears know the sound of a fine, dark cymbal made in Istanbul by hand, and this isn’t it!</p>
<p>Something feels wrong. What’s wrong? </p>
<p>Society, sociality, and community may be lossy too, just like tech!</p>
<p>We can fix tech ourselves whether we share the same physical space or create our own paradise. Fixing tech is going to be difficult since the most popular parts of the false dilemma are hard-wired. Think about it.</p>

post_content_html: <h3 id="top-3-linux-distributions-in-2022-did-they-mention-the-fourth">Top 3 Linux Distributions in 2022; did they mention the fourth?</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s suppose that you&#39;re a Linux user, or somenoe who is Linux-curious, but looking to take a weekend and free your mind from the orthodoxy that has become the traditional linux environment, where you have multiple competing dichotomies such as desktop and server, Gnome and KDE, Debian and Redhat, where what you really wanted was Linux optimized for a particular purpose - custom linux, if you will, but perhaps less bespoke.</p>
<p>If that sounds like you, you might be immutability-curious, ephemerality-curious, or tiling-curious, but haven&#39;t quite taken the leap that Neo does in the matrix. </p>
<p>Regardless, the 3 systems listed here are leading the charge into modern operating systems and while those systems are emergent, moving targets, they are approaching a tipping point of stability while the benefits of using one of them, or all of them, can be felt viscerally, as if by magic.</p>
<p>While the 3 linux distros listed below are wildly different in terms of what problem they are solving, what they share is an emergent conceptual and philosophical basis that is ephemeral and immutable.</p>
<p>File systems like zfs and btr have been on a collision course with distributed SCM for years, and these systems all prove that by taking the idea of a journalled or revisioned file system, and using that to enable system stability by combining immutability via ephemerality - meaning that the container is the fundamental _data <em>currency</em> of the underlying operating system, where the system itself is polymorphic - the state of the running OS is changed simply by switching the current container state.</p>
<p>When something breaks, much like continuous deployment systems, system stability is always just a rollback away.</p>
<p>The leading edge of containers and virtualization are all at play here in some form though the specific implementations differ somewhat.</p>
<p>Imagine a future where the last mile of humans-in-the-loop system management is replaced by autonomous system operators (agents) and you have a rough idea where this is going. The real game is instrumenting the OS with sensors that enable the system to be managed autonomously and securely at scale. </p>
<p>And now for something completely different...</p>
<h4 id="talos-linux">Talos Linux</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.talos.dev/">Talos Linux</a> takes many things we learned about cluster computing, and Kubernetes, or cloud native in particular, and visits some of those requirements back on the design of linux itself, such that the linux distribution is &quot;all system management is done via an API. No SSH, shell or console&quot;. </p>
<p>Let that sink in for a moment. If you&#39;r an experience linux user, that statement may trigger abject terror. Yes, you can survive linux without the bane of every security person&#39;s existence: a root shell. </p>
<p>Just like Kubernetes: the rise of API-driven systems infrastructure finally reaches the operating system (OS). The implications are vast and profound, particularly for those who may come from a systems management perspective, where being able to manage thousands of machines via Management Information Blocks (MIBs) was the way to scale access to thousands of machines running in a large organization. </p>
<p>Last time I checked, public or private cloud was a large organization, of computers, not people. If cloud scaled 1:1 between computers and people it wouldn&#39;t have survived much beyond its early days twenty-some years ago. Allowing compute instances to grow essentially unbounded with regard to humans is what gives cloud its reason for existence.</p>
<h4 id="fedora-silverblue">Fedora Silverblue</h4>
<p>Like Talos, <a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Silverblue</a> has at its core, the idea of immutabile infrastructure, but whereas Talos is focused on cluster computing in the form of a Kubernetes cluster, Silverblue is focused on Developer Experience (DX) - the desktop development experience that has become the achilles heel on the year of the Linux desktop asymptote. </p>
<p>Jam all of these tools together onto a single Linux desktop and the previous stability of the linux machine that you had come to rely on starts to resemble a version of Windows when Steve Ballmer was still calling the shots at Microsoft.</p>
<p>So Silverblue takes a small list of things that are uncommon and difficult to configure right now and makes them turnkey to the extent that they are installed in a complete product from an ISO USB stick that <em>just works</em>.</p>
<p>This article is kept intentionally short, but the things that make fedora silverblue unique include but are not limited to podman, gnome boxes, rpm-ostree, and so on.</p>
<h4 id="garuda-sway">Garuda Sway</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Linux">Garuda Sway</a> may be the least promoted of these futuristic alternatives as it has nothing but the traditional open source organization behind it.</p>
<p>Like me, you may arrive at Garuda Linux, having dabbled in arch for years, realizing that there are alternatives to Ubuntu and Redhat, that you may not have heard much about since they get drown out by the respective marketing machines from Canonical and IBM.</p>
<p>Garuda is one of those distros that tries to be everything to everyone on the desktop, as is the tradition in most linux distros, by providing versions based on window managers everyone has heard of, like Gnome or KDE. Unfortunately, both Gnome and KDE have suffered a popularity tipping point much like Ubuntu where they became the thing they set out to disrupt, like agile.</p>
<p>Enter Garuda Sway. Arch Linux base? Check. Tiling i3 window manager and keybindings? Check. Wayland speed? Check. Deprecate X11? Check.</p>
<p>Garuda Sway runs better on a $649 commodity laptop with 8 GB RAM than most of the aforementioned bloated desktop systems run on 16 GB.</p>
<p>Garuda Sway is probably the most tractable way to deprecate your mouse, as long as people old enough to remember OS/2 and CUA have been complaining about mouse dependence and how it slows GUI vs CLI.</p>
<p>No matter. Garuda is the path to indescribable speed, power, and simplicity that comes from being able to manage a large number of windows on a large display without your brain running out of stack space or reaching for a mouse or touchpad. </p>
<p>Put simply, Garuda Sway scales window management on the desktop to enable humans to master desktop information in a way that few have since the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5-T_S50Sr4">200 points of light demo</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/1998/01/p153-robertson.pdf">successive desktop research</a> thirty years ago.</p>
<h4 id="honorable-mention---the-game-changer---sway-on-fedora-blue-37">Honorable Mention - the game changer - Sway on Fedora Blue 37</h4>
<p>The only other thing that comes close in terms of the possibilities, is the commendable and innovative effort of <a href="https://www.piware.de/">Martin Pitt</a>. </p>
<p>Pitt took the Fedora 37 pre-release spin of Fedora Blue and built a working version of Sway on top of it!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/martinpitt/ostree-pitti-workstation">Martin Pitt&#39;s ostree-pitti-workstation</a></p>
<p>The result is remarkable since you can do all the magical things that Silverblue promises via a window management experience that is on par with the Silverblue backend.</p>
<h4 id="whats-left">What&#39;s Left?</h4>
<p>If you think about it, the only thing that <a href="https://swaywm.org/">sway</a> is missing in this iteration, is a keybinding to invoke zoom mode within a particular window or frame such that the set of tabs (or stack) if you will, is fully visualized in a rich way, and zoomable in z-order.</p>
<p><a href="https://hcipioneers.wordpress.com/portfolio/bederson-ben/">Ben Bederson&#39;s group at U Maryland</a> had researched <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pad++/">Pad++</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/piccolo/index.shtml">Piccolo</a> twenty-five years ago.</p>
<p>Adapted for the modern computing environment, you could combine that interaction with a gesture and keybinding where the rendering instantaneously scales to large numbers of spatial objects. </p>
<p>It&#39;s actually sad that these ideas never reached mobile, where gestures play a larger, if more troubling role.</p>
